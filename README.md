### Coding Challenge Guidelines

MJH Engineering Ltd Code Challenge - Task List

The challenge is to create a basic Task List using react and redux (Using a actions/reducer pattern).
Please fork this repo and send me a email with a link to your fork when you want to submit it.

For this challenge please use the api https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/, to get/post/patch data in json format.
This is a "to do list" api, but it is close enough for the purpose.
You will need to add a Promise based HTTP client, of your choosing. e.g axios or fetch

Please create the following pages

1. Index, showing a list of Tasks
2. New page, where you can create a new task
3. Edit page, where you can update a task

The form inputs should be title/body, you can set the userId=1.
The title should be a required field.

This git repo has a basic create-react-app bootstrapped into it.
Please fork this repo and then clone and run "npm install" followed by "npm start"/

### Evaluation Criteria

You can use a basic React UI framework to achieve some styling, but dont spend too much time on this.
Structure and clean code is the most important criteria.

### CodeSubmit

There is no time limit on this, but please try to keep it down to a few hours, and if you cant get there just push an attempt and i will still look at it.

Please organize, design, test and document your code as if it were
going into production - then push your changes to the master branch.

If you have any questions, please dont hesitate to contact myself, kyle@mjh.co.nz

All the best,
